    The use of field-standard approaches in neuroscience and psychology can exclude participants from research, biasing our understanding of brainâ€“behavior relations. Ricard, Parker, and colleagues discuss how we might address inequity in our scientific methodology. The cover image is a stylized illustration depicting exclusion in human neuroimaging methods.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.

Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
