    The use of field-standard approaches in neuroscience and psychology can exclude participants from research, biasing our understanding of brainâ€“behavior relations. Ricard, Parker, and colleagues discuss how we might address inequity in our scientific methodology. The cover image is a stylized illustration depicting exclusion in human neuroimaging methods.
