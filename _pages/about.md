At present, I am a post-baccalaureate neuroscience research assistant at Yale University in New Haven, CT. I am starting my PhD in neuroscience at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurogradprogram.html) in September 2023! 

You can find more about me throughout my website, and my most recent work [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YKTfMsYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
