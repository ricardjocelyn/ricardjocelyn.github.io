I am a PhD student in Neurosciences at [Stanford University](https://med.stanford.edu/neurogradprogram.html) as a [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/scholars/2023-cohort) in September 2023! 

Previously I worked as a post-baccalaureate neuroscience research assistant at Yale University in New Haven, CT and the Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) (German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) in Berlin, Germany. 

You can find more about me throughout my website, and my most recent work [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YKTfMsYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
