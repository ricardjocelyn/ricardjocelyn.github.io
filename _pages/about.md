I am currently a PhD student in Neurosciences at Stanford University. I am a National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Scholar](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships) and a Stanford University [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/scholars/2023-cohort)!

Previously, I began my role as a post-baccalaureate computational research assistant at the Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) (German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) in Berlin, Germany, followed by a research assistant position in neuroscience at Yale University in New Haven, CT.
