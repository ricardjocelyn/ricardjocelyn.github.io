I am a PhD student in Neurosciences at Stanford University and a [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/scholars/2023-cohort)!

Previously, I began my role as a post-baccalaureate computational research assistant at the Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) (German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) in Berlin, Germany, followed by a research assistant position in neuroscience at Yale University in New Haven, CT.
