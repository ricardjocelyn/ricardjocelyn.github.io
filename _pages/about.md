I am currently a PhD candidate in Neurosciences at Stanford University. I am a National Science Foundation (NSF) [Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program), a National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine [Ford Foundation Predoctoral Scholar](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships), and a Stanford University [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/scholars/2023-cohort)!

My research investigates the impact of neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., poverty and crime exposure) on adolescent neurodevelopment and its downstream effects on substance use. Additionally, I examine how methodological practices in neuroimaging impact the generalizability of neuroscience research.

Prior to starting my PhD program, I worked as a post-baccalaureate computational research assistant at the Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) (German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) in Berlin, Germany, followed by a research assistant position in neuroscience at Yale University in New Haven, CT.
