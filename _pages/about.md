At present, I am a post-baccalaureate neuroscience research assistant at Yale University in New Haven, CT. I am applying to neuroscience PhD programs starting in Fall 2022 to matriculate in September 2023. You can find more about me throughout my website, and my most recent work [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YKTfMsYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
